		color, border, font-size and margin.
		Make the text in the paragraph large
		<p style = "font-size:large">Text</p>

	Tuan: CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is one of the 3 core web technologies. Cascading refers 
		to the set of rules you'll learn in the following lessons.
	Tuan: Structure: HTML
	Tuan: Style: CSS
	Tuan: Interactivity: JavaScript
	set CssLesson = 6
	Tuan: In the next lesson, you will learn about the styling rules to create breath-taking websites.
	set CssLesson = 7
	Tuan: Adding CSS code to every HTML element takes time and makes your HTML structure unorganized.
	Tuan: In this lesson, you'll learn an alternative way to style your pages that makes your CSS code 
		more efficient.
	Tuan: In this lesson, you'll learn an alternative way to style your pages that makes your CSS code 
		more efficient.
	Tuan: When CSS code is added to HTML elements, this is called inline CSS.
	Tuan: You'll learn to style your web pages in different ways.
		The styling technique that adds CSS code inside HTML elements is called…
	- External CSS
			{{charaName[PlayerSelect]}}: External CSS. 
			set Game.currentHealth += 5
			Tuan: ❌Sorry,this is a wrong answer❌
	- Inline CSS
			{{charaName[PlayerSelect]}}: Inline CSS
			Tuan: 🎉Congratulations, this is the right answer🎉
	set CssLesson = 8
	Tuan: Inline CSS is easy to add to your code but presents some disadvantages. 
		For example, to apply the same style to more than one HTML element…
	- CSS code is added once
			{{charaName[PlayerSelect]}}: CSS code is added once. 
			set Game.currentHealth += 5
			Tuan: ❌Sorry,this is a wrong answer❌

			{{charaName[PlayerSelect]}}: CSS code needs to be repeated
			Tuan: 🎉Congratulations, this is the right answer🎉
	set CssLesson = 9
	Tuan: An alternative styling technique is internal CSS. Internal CSS is used to style the entire page. 
		The <style> container tag is added within the HTML document to group all the CSS code for the page.
	Tuan:  A.Inline CSS
		B.Internal CSS
	set CssLesson = 10
	Tuan: Separate multiple selectors with a comma to apply the same style to different elements.
		This makes your CSS code simpler.
	Tuan: Here’s a rule that applies the same style to h1 and p elements: <style>
	set CssLesson = 11
	Tuan: It's best practice to include all the internal CSS code in the <head> of the page.
	set CssLesson = 12

	Tuan:  It time for question, let me ask you some thing. 
		What's the selector for a level 1 heading?
	- <style>
			{{charaName[PlayerSelect]}}: <style> 
			set Game.currentHealth += 5
			Tuan: ❌Sorry,this is a wrong answer❌

			{{charaName[PlayerSelect]}}: h1
			Tuan: 🎉Congratulations, this is the right answer🎉
	Tuan: CSS code creates styling rules. The simplest styling rule consists of a selector, 
		plus a declaration in curly braces {}. 
		To code a rule for the buttons in the page:		button {font-size: large;}
	set CssLesson = 14
	Tuan:  It time for question, let me ask you some thing. 
		The rule above will apply to…

		In this lesson, you'll learn to use style inheritance to create more precise rules 
		and write code that is simple, organized, clear, and efficient.
	Tuan:  It time for question, let me ask you some thing. 
		 In HTML, we call it nesting when…
	- Tags are styled with CSS

	Tuan: With elements, the outer element is known as the parent, and the inner element is the child.
		Styling rules for parent elements will also be applied to child elements by default. This is
		known as inheritance. Child elements inherit styles from their parents.
	set CssLesson = 20
	Tuan: The word ideas will be displayed in…
	- Grey
			{{charaName[PlayerSelect]}}: Grey

			set Game.currentHealth += 5
			Tuan: ❌Sorry,this is a wrong answer❌
	set CssLesson = 21
	Tuan: By default, children inherit their parent’s style. If you need a child to have a different style, 
		you must write a separate rule for the child.
	Tuan: You can use a combination of selectors to make more precise rules.
		The descendant selector targets children inside a specific parent. It consists of the
		parent selector, followed by a space, followed by the child selector.
	set CssLesson = 22

if CssLesson == 25
	Tuan: For total control over the design of your HTML elements, you can give them IDs and classes.
		In this lesson, you’ll learn to use IDs to target specific individual elements, and classes
		to target groups of elements.
	Tuan: The id attribute is used to give an unique identifier to a specific element in the page.
		Give the unique intro identifier to the paragraph.
		The id attribute is used to identify unique elements in an HTML document.
	Tuan: Let me give you a question.
		True or false? You can give multiple elements the same id.
	- False
			{{charaName[PlayerSelect]}}: False
			Tuan: 🎉Congratulations, this is the right answer🎉
	- True
			{{charaName[PlayerSelect]}}: True 
			set Game.currentHealth += 5
			Tuan: ❌Sorry,this is a wrong answer❌
	set CssLesson = 26
	Tuan:  You can target specific elements use hashtag # followed by the ID name as a selector.
		Another way to identify elements is the class attribute. Use the class attribute to give the 
		same identifier to a group of elements
	Tuan: <p class = "movie">
		Avatar</p>
		<button class = "movie">
		Watch now</button>
	Tuan: Select the attribute that you’d use to apply the same style to a group of elements

	- Class
			{{charaName[PlayerSelect]}}: Class 
			Tuan: 🎉Congratulations, this is the right answer🎉
	set CssLesson = 27
	Tuan: You can create styling rules for a group of elements in the same class (group). Use a 
		dot . followed by the class name to target all the elements in the same class.
		A style rule for a class will be applied to all the elements in that class.
	Tuan: The symbol used to construct each type of selector:
		id  #
		class  .
	set CssLesson = 28
	Tuan: You can also target only those elements of a specific type that have a certain class.
		This CSS rule will modify only paragraphs with the content class.

	Tuan: !! In the next lesson, you’ll learn the algorithm used by browsers to determine the CSS declaration 
		that is the most relevant to an element.
	set CssLesson = 31
	Tuan: In the previous lessons, you learned different ways to target HTML elements for styling.
		In this lesson, you'll learn how web browsers decide what rule to prioritize when several 
		rules are targeting the same element at the same time.
	Tuan: An HTML element can be targeted for styling in different ways. For example, an element
		may have both a class and an ID.
	Tuan: Here are 3 ways to target the same HTML element. Find the correct type of selector for 
		each method
	Tuan: Element selector: p
	Tuan: ID selector: #text1
	Tuan: Class selector: .info
	set CssLesson = 32
	Tuan: Each type of CSS selector has its place in this priority list. When several CSS rules
		target the same HTML element, the browser uses this order to decide which rule to apply.
	Tuan: This priority order is known as specificity. Specificity is the algorithm used by 
		browsers to determine the rule to apply to an element.
	set CssLesson = 33
	Tuan: Inline style has priority over the element rule. The text will be aligned to the…
	- Center
			{{charaName[PlayerSelect]}}: Center
			set Game.currentHealth += 5
			Tuan: ❌Sorry,this is a wrong answer❌
	- Left
			{{charaName[PlayerSelect]}}: Left

	- Right
			{{charaName[PlayerSelect]}}: Right 
			Tuan: 🎉Congratulations, this is the right answer🎉
	set CssLesson = 34
	Tuan: You can add notes or explanations to your CSS code. Comments help other humans
		(and future you!) to read your code.
		Comments in CSS start with /* and end with */
	Tuan: When use the internal style technique…
	- lines of CSS code are distributed across the HTML document
			{{charaName[PlayerSelect]}}: lines of CSS code are distributed across the HTML document 
			set Game.currentHealth += 5
			Tuan: ❌Sorry,this is a wrong answer❌
	- all CSS code is grouped together in the HTML document in one set of <style> tags
			{{charaName[PlayerSelect]}}: all CSS code is grouped together in the HTML document in one set of <style> tags
			Tuan: 🎉Congratulations, this is the right answer🎉 
	set CssLesson = 35
	Tuan: An alternative to inline and internal CSS is external CSS. External CSS code is written
		outside the HTML document, in a separate file.
	set CssLesson = 36
	Tuan: One of the advantages of external CSS is that the same CSS styles file can be used by
		multiple HTML documents (or web pages).A:
	Tuan: A: internal CSS
	Tuan: B: external CSS
	Tuan: Some developers prefer external CSS because it separates structure and style into
		different files. This means your web page project will consist of several files with
		different file extensions.
	Tuan: *.html: structure
	Tuan: *.css: style
	Tuan: External CSS is very useful for multi-page websites, as you can style the entire site in
		one place.
